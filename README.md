# Getting Started with The Admin App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Libraries

In the project directory, you will see some amazing libraries that was used as tools to help in the production of the application:

### `npm rechart`

This library was used in the project for my analytics sections. It is a powerful and a easy to use liberary, that i used in making my piechat, linegraph, and the doughnut like chart.

### `material UI`

This amazing resource helped me in overcoming the hassle of css with its already customized components and elements. It helped me focus more on the logic more than the designing.

### `react redux toolkit`

Stage management has been one of the issues to deal with in a react application and for code reuseability and neatness probs drilling is not of best practices. I love react context API alos, but the simplicity and effectiveness that comes with using redux toolkit is so amazing that i just have to use the library.
It is the library i use for my state transfer in the project.

## Challenges and how they were tackled

This project was inspired because i wanted to show my abilities to build applications using advance modern tools, being someone who loves generic css, I  hvae been comfortable with SCSS, Bootstrap, and Tailwind scss. I just had to challenge myself.

### `Balancing with Material UI`

I am a developer who priorise my users experiwnce as they are using my applications or websites, So with that in mind, I always build together from the start, the mobile view. Alot of users are comfortable quickly going through websites and applications on their mobiles than the Desktop or Laptop, So I design with a Desktop view and customise the mobile view along.

I had some challenges with the library because of its rigidity or I should say my inadequate experience using the library on my projects, I am cofortable building components but buildiuilding isn't just everything. I need to combine those components into a view page for the UI to render, making it responsive was a challenge I was able to solve thanks to stackoverflow and the popular openai application.
